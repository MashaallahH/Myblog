      <p>I always wanted to create a website, but I had no idea where to start. So I decided to begin with the basics: HTML and CSS.</p>

      <h3>1. Starting with HTML</h3>
      <p>HTML is the foundation of every website. I learned how to use tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> to add content to my page. I also used <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to insert images.</p>

      <h3>2. Adding CSS for Style</h3>
      <p>Once I had the structure, I used CSS to make it look better. I changed fonts, colors, and added spacing. I also made a simple layout using margins and padding.</p>

      <h3>3. Seeing It All Come Together</h3>
      <p>When I opened the file in my browser and saw my website come to life, it felt amazing! It was simple, but it was mine. And I built it from scratch.</p>

      <h3>4. What's Next?</h3>
      <p>Now that I understand the basics, I'm planning to learn JavaScript and make my website interactive. The journey has just begun!</p>
